# healthCheckMasseuse
Converts existing health checks into cleaner formats

Came out of using greenyet - https://github.com/cburgmer/greenyet

There are a number of data sources and healthchecks that would not automatically fit into its structure, especially legacy apps that may not easily be changed. The idea of this app was to provide a quick way to convert existing formats into a greenyet friendly json payload.

WIP still, apologies...
